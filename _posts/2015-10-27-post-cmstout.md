Here's a quick post of a Coffee Milk Stout recipe that I wrote up. I first brewed this with my dad and it scored a 32/50 by a BJCP judge, which is in the "Very Good" (30-37) range. It probably would've scored even higher with better carbonation, I'd aim for 2.6 volumes. Here's the recipe, with a little more roasted barley, a little less lactose, and Irish Ale yeast. Dry bean-ing 1 cup of fresh coffee beans for 24hrs per 2.5 gallons gives a great coffee aroma.
