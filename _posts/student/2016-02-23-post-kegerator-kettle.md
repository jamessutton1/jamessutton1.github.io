Short update because I'm busy with school: I got a kegerator and I kettle soured my first beer. I used the bacteria on acid malt to sour the beer down to around a pH of 3.5 from 5.5 after the mash over 2 days. I used a heating pad in my ferm chamber to keep the temperature above 100F. It's a gose recipe and it's fermenting now, I'm excited to see how it tastes.

I received a custom tap handle as a Christmas gift recently and, as I felt like having to bottle was keeping me back from brewing as much as I would've liked, so I bit the bullet and got one off craigslist. I haven't quite dialed in the CO2 levels yet, but I got an adequately carbed beer after just 2 days, and it's cold and the number of friends that have tried my homebrew has increased exponentially since then. The MO-pollo SMaSH IPA is great! The Maris Otter lends a nice malty sweetness, and the Apollo is very citrusy and the dryhopping lent a nice aroma... funny what 8oz of hops will do! In hindsight if I knew I was going to keg this beer, I don't think I would've made it 7.5% ABV, but it sure is delicious.
