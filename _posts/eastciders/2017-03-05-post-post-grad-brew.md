Since I last posted I've been promoted to a Quality Technician role at Austin Eastciders. This new title has been exciting as I work in production support, helping ensure new and existing product quality and helping develop new and better processes. My biggest projects have been focused on increasing shelf-life and helping develop one of our new products, a blood orange cider.

As far as brewing has gone, I judged my first BJCP sanctioned homebrew competition and have brewed a few beers, including another best bitter, another festbier, a brett-trois dry-hopped cider, a stout (my girlfriend Melissa's first brew ever!), a centennial IPA... Not sure what to brew next for maybe one of the first times ever. Black IPA, pale ale, who knows.

Best bitter, great clarity. Really hoping to medal with this one at Bluebonnet this year:
