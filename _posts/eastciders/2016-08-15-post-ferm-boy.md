Since I've graduated I've moved, started working at a cider company as a Fermentation Specialist, and brewed three beers. Not a bad three months. One of the beers I brewed is a Festbier, my first lager, and is fermenting away right now at 54F with the dry Weihenstephaner lager culture. As a lager, it has a slightly more involved fermentation profile and as such, I've finally come up with a nice looking log to track my fermentations. Feel free to use it if you are a brewer and want something to tack on your ferm chamber to keep track of all your damn beer.

P.S. Here are a couple pics of some beers I've brewed recently. They include my base saison with Jester King's house culture, a vienna pale ale, and a best bitter. Gratuitous pictures of my dinner included with a couple. Maybe I'll write some about cooking once I get a bit better.
